I would like to comment on the following:
1) Making the classes in this package public
2) Including the models that I did

With respect to the first point, I made these classes public in order to
ensure that there would be no conflicts with flexJSON's parsing into
these objects, as well as to make sure that the user of the client has
full access to the information in each Business, since he or she may need
to extract/move this information.

I included all models that I could create from the venue search response, as specified
on Foursquare's developer documentation, including some that I found are virtually
never returned (Hours, for example). These models are included generally without JavaDocs,
since I included a link to the most relevant docs that describe each object and its attributes
in the JavaDoc that summarizes each class.
