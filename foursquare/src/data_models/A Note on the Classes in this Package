I would like to explain my decision to make these data models public, and also to make
a comment on why some models (such as business hours) are not present.

I felt as though it would be more practical for me to make these classes public, since
I wanted the user to be able to pick which data they wanted from each individual Business
instance they received from the FoursquareResults class. Additionally, it appeared to me
as though it would be very difficult for the client to get specific results from the
FoursquareResults class if these classes were available only to FoursquareResults. Also
note that these classes need only have getter/setter functions for use by flexJSON, and
this is the reason for the model classes' minimal commenting and empty constructors.

With respect to the absence of certain (and in my opinion, very pertinent) models, I 
have found that the "optional" business hours data, for example, does not appear in the
venue search results, even for established businesses such as Starbucks. This is despite
my attempts to retrieve these optional data even while using OAuth (I was not previously).
I have a feeling that I am using a different search method than the Foursquare API expects
in order for it to return these "optional" data, but I have no proof of where my method
is incorrect (yet).
